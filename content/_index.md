# BIOGRAPHY

I am Yingzhe Han (韩颖哲), a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I am working in [Laboatory of Ocular Biomechanics](https://www.ocularbiomechanics.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ian Sigal](https://www.ocularbiomechanics.com/People.html). My research interests include ocular biomechanics and computational modeling. I am currently working on the development of fiber models to simulate the biomechanical behavior of the optic nerve head in glaucoma.
