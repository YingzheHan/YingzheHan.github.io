# BIOGRAPHY

I am Yingzhe Han (韩颖哲), a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I am part of [Laboatory of Ocular Biomechanics](https://www.ocularbiomechanics.com/), where I work under the supervision of [Dr. Ian A. Sigal](https://www.ocularbiomechanics.com/People.html).

My research interests lie primarily in the field of soft tissue biomechanics. My current work focuses on investigating the biomechanical behavior of the optic nerve head through advanced computational modeling techniques, aiming to elucidate the mechanical factors contributing to the pathogenesis of glaucoma.
